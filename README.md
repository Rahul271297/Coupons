First of all I have used Javascript and Node.js to create this project.
I have made 3 api's.


1ST API.- POST API TO CREATE/GENERATE COUPONS.


2ND API - GET API TO FETCH ALL THE COUPONS GENERATED.


3RD API - AGAIN A POST API TO VALIDATE THE COUPONS ON THE ORDER.



I HAVE USED POSTMAN TOOL TO CHECK MY API'S .

I HAVE INTERACTED WITH MONGOOSE TO STORE MY DATA IN THE DATABASE i.e. MONGODB.
